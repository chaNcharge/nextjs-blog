# Learning React and NextJS
Today I finished learning the basics and the intermediate details of how to write code in React and NextJS to build good looking and responsive websites using existing programming knowledge. I hope to expand more learning TypeScript and JavaScript coming from remembering a lot of Python, Java, and C++. 

This is a really interesting topic for me! Some things I like are 
- How easy websites are to create compared to the old fashioned way
- The fact that JavaScript logic can be easily integrated with website design
- Creating new pages in NextJS is super simple thanks to its easy routing

I want to learn more in TypeScript and integrate it into this project and more future projects soon! Remember to read the docs!
